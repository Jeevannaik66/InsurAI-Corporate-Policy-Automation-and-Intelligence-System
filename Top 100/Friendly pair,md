# Question
Write a Java program that reads two numbers from the user and checks whether they form a Friendly Pair.  
(Two numbers are a Friendly Pair if the sum of divisors of each number divided by the number itself is equal, e.g., 6 and 28)

# Code
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class FriendlyPair {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int sumA = 0, sumB = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= a / 2; i++) {
            if (a % i == 0) sumA += i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= b / 2; i++) {
            if (b % i == 0) sumB += i;
        }
        if ((float)sumA / a == (float)sumB / b) {
            System.out.println(a + " and " + b + " are a Friendly Pair");
        } else {
            System.out.println(a + " and " + b + " are not a Friendly Pair");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

# Example Run 1
Quest:
```
Enter first number: 6
Enter second number: 28
```
Output:
```
6 and 28 are a Friendly Pair
```

# Example Run 2
Quest:
```
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 18
```
Output:
```
12 and 18 are not a Friendly Pair
```

# Example Run 3
Quest:
```
Enter first number: 220
Enter second number: 284
```
Output:
```
220 and 284 are a Friendly Pair
```
